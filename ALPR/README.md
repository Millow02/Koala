## Overview

This **Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)** system is part of the **Koala** project, designed to identify and track license plates using:
- **YOLOv11** for object detection,
- **Custom CNN models** for classification,
- And supporting libraries to run efficiently even on resource-constrained devices like the Raspberry Pi.

---

## Features

- **Real-time license plate detection** and recognition
- **Lightweight and efficient** for edge devices
- **Modular design** for easy integration into larger systems
- **Python-based** for cross-platform compatibility

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your development environment and run the ALPR system.

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

From within the `ALPR` directory (or the root project directory), create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set the PYTHONPATH

Before running the ALPR scripts, ensure the `ALPR` folder is recognized as the root directory:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/home/z4hed/COEN490/Koala/ALPR:$PYTHONPATH"
```


### 4. Usage

You can now run the ALPR system. For example:

```bash
python demo/alpr top.py
```
